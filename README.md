# CAN_Notes
notes related to CAN


### 1. What is CAN?
- **CAN (Controller Area Network)** is a robust serial communication protocol designed for real-time data exchange between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in vehicles and industrial automation.
- Developed by Bosch in the 1980s, now a global standard in automotive and embedded systems.

### 2. Why CAN? (Key Reasons)
- Needed for reliable, fast, and noise-immune communication among multiple ECUs in vehicles.
- **Multimaster & Asynchronous:** Any node can start communication at any time.
- **High noise immunity:** Uses dual twisted pair wiring.
- **Low latency:** Small frame size (8 bytes data) ensures quick transmission.
- **Highly reliable:** Built-in error detection and handling.

### 3. CAN Properties & Features

| Property         | CAN Protocol Details                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Type             | Serial, Wired, Asynchronous                  |
| Topology         | Bus (dual twisted pair)                       |
| Speed            | Up to 1 Mbps (standard CAN)                  |
| Data per Frame   | 8 bytes                                      |
| Communication    | Multicast (message-based, not node-based)    |
| Fault Tolerance  | High                                         |
| Protocol         | CSMA-CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access - Collision Avoidance) |
| Acknowledgement  | Special field in every frame, no extra frame  |
| Filtering        | Message filtering based on Message ID         |

### 4. CAN vs. Other Protocols

| Feature         | CAN         | FlexRay     | Ethernet      |
|-----------------|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Bus Type        | Dual twisted pair | Dual twisted pair | Wire/Optical Fibre |
| Speed           | 1 Mbps      | 10 Mbps     | 100 Mbps+     |
| Data per Frame  | 8 bytes     | 264 bytes   | 1500 bytes    |
| Type            | Asynchronous| Synchronous | Point-to-point|
| Fault Tolerance | High        | Medium      | Low           |

### 5. Communication Modes

- **Wired vs. Wireless:** CAN is a wired protocol (Ethernet is another example; wireless includes Bluetooth, WiFi).
- **Peer-to-Peer vs. Broadcast:** CAN is multicast (similar to broadcast, one-to-many), not strictly peer-to-peer.
- **Message-Based:** Each frame is identified by a Message ID (not by sender/receiver node).
